For the OCIW/AMCC device driver, see the file ociwpc/INSTALL.TXT

For DV, see the file dv/README.dv2.txt  but basically, if it does not
compile, then there are missing packages that will need to be added, e.g. GSL
and GTK stuff.  Note: the DV_HOME environment variable and .dv-init file are 
absolutely needed, so do those steps.

In the dsp user's .bashrc file, add:
export LC_CTYPE=C
export LC_NUMERIC=C
export LC_COLLATE=C

export CUPS_SERVER=lp.pas.rochester.edu
export PRINTER=CopyRoom

export LM_LICENSE_FILE=1700@crunch.pas.rochester.edu

export IDLHOME=$HOME/idlpro
export IDL_STARTUP=$IDLHOME/startup.pro

export DV_HOME=/usr/local/dv
# Not sure what this did, but it was on Itchy circa 2013.
alias dv='XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 dv'

PYDSPHOME=/home/dsp/dsp
export PYDSPHOME
alias pydsp='python -tt -i ${PYDSPHOME}/pydsp/start_pydsp.py'
alias spydsp='python -tt -i ${PYDSPHOME}/pydsp/client.py'

## end of stuff to add to .bashrc file

For Filter Wheel Stepper Motor control:
Install the Python parallel port module (python-parallel).
Now, the module 'lp' must not be loaded, but it is a kernel module so you 
cannot just simply blacklist it, you have to do a little more.  Luckily you 
don't have to recompile the kernel to remove it (anymore).  Do the following:

 a) Edit /etc/modules and comment out lp and add ppdev
 b) Edit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist and add "blacklist lp"
    Also create a file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-lp.conf with the line
    "blacklist lp"
    Not sure about doing both, but didn't work with just the first one.
 c) run: dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-$(uname -r)
 d) edit /etc/default/cups (on older linux systems F10 or U8.10) 
      OR /etc/modules-load.d/cups-filters.conf (on newer >14.04 ??)  
    and set LOAD_LP_MODULE=no
 e) reboot

Next, add the dsp user to the lp group so that dsp can write to /dev/parport0 
gpasswd -a dsp lp

For the temperature controller:
Install the Python Serial port module
You can either add dsp to same group as the one that owns /dev/ttyS0
gpasswd -a dsp dialout
Or you can modify the /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.permissions file that is 
used to create the devices at boot time.  Set ttyS*:root:uucp:0666
