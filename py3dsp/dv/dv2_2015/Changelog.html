<b> DV version 2013.05 </b>

+ Compile and ran under 32 and 64bit linux.

  This is a buggy widget with memory leaks, I was calling gtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder()
  in update_file_save_dialog() when every time data in the buffer changed causing
  performance issue and growing memory footprint on very call.
  I am limit calling it now, so problem exist but hopefully it has minimal impact.
