Preamplification for astronomical cameras
=========================================

* the typical signal source is a source-follower
  from the imaging device. Load resistances in the
  hundreds of kilohms or so, creating a source impedance 
  of a few kilohms.

* Traditionally, instrumentation amplifiers have been used.
  The instrumentation amplifier is useful in situations when there
  is significant common-mode noise, and the impedances of each
  line on the differential signal are equal.

* Common sensors used in instrumentation amplifier applications:
  Wheatstone bridges, pickup coils, etc. These sensors are often 
  free-floating (not grounded at either end) or in a symmetrical
  circuit that is attached to a completely different system ground.

The astronomical array output is not, by nature a differential output,
although this is certainly an option to explore. 
Also, there is not usually any significant common-mode noise, so it
is arguable that an instrumentation amp is not the most appropriate choice.

Noise issues
============

A single array output is typically sampled at rates in the 
hundreds of kilohertz or better. It is desired to read the output
to microvolt noise levels.

Gain issues
===========

Typical gains required are between 10 and 50 depending upon the
A/D converter's input range and
  
Bandwidth issues
================

Obtaining high accuracy requires fast op-amps even if
signal bandwidth is not too large.

Offset issues
=============

Often, the array output operates at a sizable offset from the
ground reference. As a result, either the offset needs to enter
the input stage, or several stages of amplification are needed.
