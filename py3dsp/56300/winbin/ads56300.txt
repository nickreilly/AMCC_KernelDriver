1. Fixed     program access error caused by out-of-scope c-function variables.
2. Added     host debugclock functionality.  Now it is possible to run the
	     hardware at one clock rate in normal execution and run it at
	     a different clock rate in debug mode.
3. Fixed     slow behavior of the GUI when debugging with source window open.
	     The new implementation was at least 7 times faster during the
	     tests.
4. Modified  the source code for the PC.  Now there are no support for Win 3.1
	     and the same executable can be used for both WinNT and Win95.
5. Added     support for reading the FIFO and second breakpoint registers.
====
ADS56300, Version 6.2.2, Apr 21, 1998

1. Cancelled 56362 device password protection.  The 56362 device is now in the
             list of devices available through the simulator device command.
====
ADS56300, Version 6.1.16, Dec 31, 1997
1. Corrected command converter reset problem.  This problem occured randomly
	     while in the host reset stage.
2. Corrected incorrect l-memory window contents
3. Enhanced  the debug-symbol construction stage.  This operation is carried-
	     out after loading the program image into the ADS hardware.  We
	     found cases where this stage may took a very long time.  Now, it
	     is a fraction of what it used to be.  Observed a speed improvement
	     of 93.3X
====
ADS56300, Version 6.1.15, Dec 12, 1997
1. Corrected command converter reset problem.  This problem occured when there

	     command.
2. Corrected the "system" command on the GUI version.
3. Added     support for better handling the multiple devices.
4. Added     command for setting the comand converter speed.
