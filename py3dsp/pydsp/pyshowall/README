pyshowall
=========

a python version of gshowall..

the 'gshowall.glade' file is XML, edited with 'glade-2' . 
Change it with the command line 'glade-2 gshowall.glade' .

save frequently if you have an old version.
it wasn't too stable as of 
Feb 2004.

In Oct 2004, on a Fedora Core 2 box, this seems much better.

pydsp hooks into most of this stuff
by agreeing upon the names.
when the python name is different, a namemap
dictionary maps the python name to the 
gshowall name.

The gshowall box called 'detfile_txt'
is the python run dictionary entry for
'detname'. rd.namemap maps 'detname' to 'detfile'
and pyshowall.py adds the '_txt' on when looking
for the widget.

TODO: the namemapping could use a little refactor.
hard to say if it belongs in the run dict or the GUI..
I think perhaps the GUI, as the system can run gui-less.

(The gui can run systemless too, but that isn't normal.)
