Before 2019-03-26:
    I just recently was able to get the program to communicate with the
CY8-board over USB, this was a major step of progress and puts the project
on firm footing, I only wish I had a little more experience doing this
sort of thing. I wan't to make the project a little more OOPy, not out
of any love for the paradigm but it seems like the natural way to write
the program to allow for similar compatability no matter how we interface
with the black box. So there needs to be a common interface between these
components:

    - Dummy Mode
    - PCI (ociw?)
    - USB

The dev.py file seems to be the natural place to do this. Also I wanted
to map out the files in their relation to one another, plus really look
at how all the threads pop up, I want to make sure shut-down works right.
