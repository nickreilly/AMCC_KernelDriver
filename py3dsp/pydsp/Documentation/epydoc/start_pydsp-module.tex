\section{Module start\_pydsp}

    \label{start_pydsp}
The top level file of the pydsp system. all execution starts here. A 
shell-bang could have been used, but we used an alias instead.

Basically, start the DSP thread, initialize the runtime hooks, start the 
gui thread Start some extra stuff like runline completion, then bring the 
control system to life. finally, dump into the command loop.

    \index{start\_pydsp \textit{(module)}!start\_pydsp.initHardware \textit{(function)}}

    \vspace{0.5ex}

    \begin{boxedminipage}{\textwidth}

    \raggedright \textbf{initHardware}()

    \vspace{-1.5ex}

    \rule{\textwidth}{0.5\fboxrule}
    Initialize the dsp device.

    Open up the device driver. start the singleton dsp thread.

    \label{start_pydsp:loadDetAndRun}
    \index{start\_pydsp \textit{(module)}!start\_pydsp.loadDetAndRun \textit{(function)}}

    \vspace{0.5ex}

    \begin{boxedminipage}{\textwidth}

    \raggedright \textbf{loadDetAndRun}()

    \vspace{-1.5ex}

    \rule{\textwidth}{0.5\fboxrule}
    Load the det (static) and run (volatile) dictionaries.

    This effectively fires up the system, for instance: setting the clock 
    program attribute is a "smart" operation, and loads the clock program 
    into the DSP as well.

    \end{boxedminipage}

    \label{start_pydsp:startPyshowall}
    \index{start\_pydsp \textit{(module)}!start\_pydsp.startPyshowall \textit{(function)}}

    \vspace{0.5ex}

    \begin{boxedminipage}{\textwidth}

    \raggedright \textbf{startPyshowall}()

    \vspace{-1.5ex}

    \rule{\textwidth}{0.5\fboxrule}
    Attempt to start the pyshowall GUI.

    The gui is coupled to the det and run dictionaries. Each dictionary has
    a set\_widget method that is called when one of the attribuetes is 
    changed. This updates the GUI. Some widget names are different from 
    attribute names, so a namemap translates from one to the other.
