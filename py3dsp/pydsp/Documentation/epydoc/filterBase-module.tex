    \label{filterBase}
filterBase.py    Base Filter Classes. (Replaces FILTERWH.FTH)

contains both fixed and variable filters. they *could* both inherit from a 
common "filter" base class.. but at the current complexity level, it 
doesn't really seem helpful to do so.

Filters support a simple interface... You basically set the filter to some 
value.

CV filters are set by wavelength. fixed filters are set by filter name.

The lowest level of this ultimately moves the wheel to some angle.. This 
module has a dummy move method that gets overridded with the real move 
method. A single wheel is assumed in the current implementation.

\subsection{Class fixedFilter}

    \label{filterBase:fixedFilter}
Fixed filter base class.

fixed filters have named filters that know their positions. a move method 
is mixed in, so they can accept move requests.
