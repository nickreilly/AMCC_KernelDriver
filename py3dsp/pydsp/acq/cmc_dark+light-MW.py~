"""
cmc_dark+light.py - a script to run in pydsp.
    
  1) aquires images in SUTR mode with the first set in the dark, 
  2) moves the filter wheel to filter with high background, 
  3) sets the reset clock to zero (off),
  4) takes more SUTR images in the light
  5) moves the filter wheel back to cds (dark)
  6) takes more SUTR data in the dark to allow diodes to debias to zero.
  7) sets the reset clock back to default.
