#      updated voltages
#
#      Revision 1.2  2003/07/16 00:14:24  dsp
#      got all the names, and the voltages too.
#
# 
# this file sets up the dacs to the number of millivolts specified here.
# it does it in the order that the voltages are found in the file.
# upon reset, all of the voltages are zero.

# Turn off all voltages.  Recall that any clock which has a "bar" is off
# in the high state.
